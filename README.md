# Zhu Yuechen's Portfolio 🌐

Welcome to my personal website - a digital playground where I share what I’ve built, learned, and loved in tech.

This site is a reflection of my journey as a software engineer, game developer, and someone who’s passionate about creating things that work beautifully (and look good doing it).

## 🧩 What’s Inside

- **Projects**  
  Explore a showcase of my work - from Unity games and blockchain tools to AI experiments and web/mobile apps. Each project comes with a write-up, tech stack, and links to code or live demos when available.

- **About Me**  
  A quick intro to who I am, what I’m into, and what keeps me building.

- **Skills & Experience**  
  A rundown of the tools, frameworks, and technologies I use professionally and for fun.

- **Contact**  
  Reach out directly via a contact modal powered by EmailJS - no backend needed.

## 🏗️ Project Structure & Approach

- **Component-Based HTML**  
  Each section (navbar, hero, about, experience, projects, skills, contact, footer) lives in its own HTML file under `/components/html/` for easy editing and reusability.

- **Modular CSS**  
  Styles are split into logical files under `/css/components/` (e.g., `hero.css`, `about-experience.css`, `projects.css`).
  Responsive design is baked in using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and modern viewport units (`clamp()`, `vw`, `vh`).

- **JavaScript (ES Modules)**  
  All interactive features are organized in separate ES modules under `/js/modules/`, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable. Each feature (animations, navigation, UI effects, contact form) lives in its own module.

- **Assets**  
  Images, icons, and other static files live under `/assets/`.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **HTML5 + CSS3 (Modular, Responsive)**  
  Built for all devices, with a focus on clean, maintainable code.

- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules)**  
  No frameworks needed — just modern JS organized as ES modules for better maintainability and code separation. Each feature (animations, navigation, UI effects, contact form) lives in its own module.

- **GSAP, particles.js, VanillaTilt**  
  For smooth animations and interactive backgrounds.

- **EmailJS**  
  Handles contact form submissions without a backend.

- **Static Hosting**  
  Deployable on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host.

## 💡 Why This Structure?

- **Easy to update:** Change one component or style file, and you’re done.
- **Scalable:** Add new sections or features without breaking the rest.
- **Modern & Responsive:** Looks great everywhere, thanks to viewport-based font sizes and mobile-first CSS.
