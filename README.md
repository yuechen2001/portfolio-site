# Zhu Yuechen's Portfolio üåê

Welcome to my personal website - a space where I document and share what I've built, what I‚Äôve learned, and what I‚Äôm excited about in tech.

This site reflects my journey as a software engineer, game developer, and someone who just really enjoys making things that work (and look good doing it).

## üß© What‚Äôs Inside

- **Projects**  
  A collection of things I‚Äôve worked on - from Unity games and blockchain tools to AI side projects and mobile apps. Each one includes a short write-up, the tech stack, and links to code or live versions where possible.

- **About Me**  
  A quick overview of my background, interests, and what drives me to keep building.

- **Skills & Experience**  
  A breakdown of the tools, frameworks, and technologies I use regularly.

- **Contact**  
  There‚Äôs a simple contact modal powered by EmailJS - feel free to drop me a message directly from the site.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **HTML5 + CSS3**  
  Designed to be responsive and lightweight across devices.

- **Vanilla JavaScript (modular)**  
  All functionality is cleanly organized into modular files for easy maintenance.

- **Component-Based Layout**  
  Each section (e.g., navbar, projects, contact) is dynamically loaded for better structure and reusability.

- **Animations**  
  GSAP, particles.js, and VanillaTilt add subtle, interactive effects without overwhelming the page.

- **EmailJS Integration**  
  The contact form works without a backend, thanks to EmailJS.

- **Static Deployment**  
  The site is fully static ‚Äî ready for platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

Thanks for visiting ‚Äî hope you enjoy browsing as much as I enjoyed building it.
