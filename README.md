  Each section (navbar, hero, about, projects, etc.) is loaded dynamically as an HTML component, ensuring a DRY and organized codebase.

  The contact modal uses EmailJS for secure, spam-free messaging‚Äîno backend required!

- **Deployed as a Static Site:**  
  The site is optimized for static hosting platforms like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify.
